            <p id="stub-text">Sharks are carnivores, meaning they primarily consume a variety of meat. One being fish. A staple food for many shark species, including smaller fish like herring and mackerel, as well as larger fish like tuna and rays. Another being Marine Mammals. Some larger shark species, such as great white sharks, prey on marine mammals like seals, sea lions, and dolphins. Additionally, many shark species consume invertebrates, such as squid, octopus, and crustaceans like crabs and shrimp. Lastly Carrion, some sharks, like the tiger shark, are known as "garbage cans of the sea" and will scavenge on dead or dying animals, including other sharks.</p>

                <p class="middle">Sharks, as apex predators, have diverse dietary needs that vary based on species, size, and habitat. Different shark species have unique dietary adaptations. For example, whale sharks are filter feeders, consuming plankton, while great white sharks are apex predators that hunt larger prey. As sharks grow, their dietary needs change. Smaller sharks may primarily consume fish, while larger sharks may incorporate larger prey into their diet. The availability of prey in a specific habitat can influence a shark's diet. For instance, sharks living in coastal waters may have different dietary needs than those living in the open ocean.</p>
