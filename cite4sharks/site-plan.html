        [With this site the type of questions we expect to answer would be about sharks overall and that includes their feeding habits and where some feeding areas are. I would really like this to be a learning experience and hopes it encourages people to visit an aquarium, or any place where they hold sharks to see they are just animals. The information would be a simple search in a phones maps app, prebuilt navigation system, would tell them where their nearest aquarium is.]

      <p>
        [The truth is that sharks rarely attack humans. There were 69 unprovoked shark bites worldwide, with 36 in the U.S. in 2023. This was a 12.2% decrease from 2022. which only contained 57 unprovoked worldwide. In fact it is important that we keep them in mind they are dwellers of the sea which is getting more and more affected by pollution and climate change. From the NOAA Fisheries we learn that 15 species of sharks have been listed as endangered and 6 species have been listen as threatened. There is a growing concern for these animals because they are top predators integral to the food web/chain of the underwater eco system.]

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        [From the University of California Museum of Paleontology we learn that for the great white shark specifically is native to the waters off central California offer a rich bounty of food for white sharks, and every summer and fall they actively feed in nearshore areas. The Farallon Islands, a national wildlife refuge about 27 miles off San Francisco, is a common feeding ground for the sharks. They also tend to be around the Año Nuevo State Reserve. Humans don’t fit into a sharks diet they search for fish and large sea mammals such as dolphins and seals. They also eat turtles, seagulls, and even other sharks because their teeth and jaws are strong enough to chew through tough skin, bones, and hard shells. Shark attacks could be because the see a surfer and mistake them for seals or a larger mammal.]
